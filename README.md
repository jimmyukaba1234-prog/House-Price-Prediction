House Price Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a real-estate dataset and multiple regression techniques. The goal is to understand the key factors that influence housing prices and to evaluate how different regression models perform in terms of accuracy, stability, and interpretability.

Data Preparation

Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing numerical features for modeling.

Ensured data quality and consistency to improve model performance and reliability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted exploratory data analysis to examine relationships between features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and house prices.

Translated complex statistical patterns into clear, human-centered insights to support decision-making.

Modeling Approach

Trained and compared Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and LASSO Regression models using an 80/20 train–test split.

Applied regularization techniques (L2 for Ridge and L1 for LASSO) to improve model stability and control overfitting.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics.

Observed similar predictive performance across models, with regularized models maintaining accuracy while improving coefficient stability.

Feature Interpretation

Interpreted model coefficients to identify key price drivers.

Found that structural features such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms positively influence house prices, while factors such as distance from the city center, house age, crime rate, and noise level negatively impact property values.
